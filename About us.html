        Sir Sayyed College of Arts, Commerce & Science is one of the minority institutions in Aurangabad city.
      
        In the year 2012 NAAC reaccredited the college.
        <br><br>
        
        It is one of the leading institutions engaged in imparting quality education in the stream of Arts, Commerce & Science since two decades. 
      <br>
        The college is located in the predominantly Muslim area.
        <br> The location holds importance as it makes the college easily accessible to the purdah-observing girl
        <br> students whom the conservative family set-up usually do not permit to go to distant colleges for higher education.<br><br>

        The college is marching ahead under the able guidance of Prof. Mohd Tilawat Ali, founder president of Rehbar Educational, Cultural & Welfare Society, 
        Aurangabad; 
        <br>
        with the strong belief that mere imparting and acquisition of formal knowledge does not suffice.
        <br>
        It strongly holds that unless a student develops a humane, scientific outlook and a strong sense of responsibility towards our society,
        <br> the aim of higher education remains unachieved.<br>
         The devoted and committed teacher, Prof. Mohd Tilawat Ali established a college that could meet the demand of changing times. <br>
         Prof. Mohd Tilawat Ali and his selfless colleagues named this college after legendary SIR SAYYED AHMED KHAN, 
         <br>an optimistic social reformer and visionary who laid paramount emphasis on Muslim's and especially women's education.<br> 
         It is in fact the only co-education college in the town that has largest number of girl students.
         <br> Focus on the women's education is a task of crucial importance this institution has undertaken. <br>Without women's education, upliftment of this particular section of the society cannot be visualized.<br>
        Education would enable women to value the significance of co-existence, 
        <br>tolerance and mutual trust that is needed in a multicultural society of ours. <br>
        The college has been making strident efforts in this direction <br>
        with a firm belief that education and uplift of the largest minority would contribute to the peace and progress of the nation at large.<br>
         With the modest beginning in 1990, Sir Sayyed College has now evolved as a full-fledged college with many courses.<br><br>
        The college has been constantly striving to add new courses in an endeavor to offer quality education and prepare students to face new challenges of 21st century.<br>
         The college offer Arts, Commerce & Science at junior and undergraduate level.<br>
          Postgraduate courses in Arabic, Urdu, English, Commerce& Chemistry are available.<br>
           To meet the changing economic challenges,<br>
            the college offer three years professional degree courses such as B.B.A & B.C.S. <br>
            The ongoing century being of youth, the Institution is confident and sure that the new, dynamic and positive thinking of President Dr. ShamamaParveen will lead the institution <br>
            from the front and take the institution to appreciable heights.<br>
             Thus unparalleled progress be achieved. This will help to increase the level of education amongst the educationally backward Muslims Particularly women. <br>The institution has always taken the initiative to prove its mission Humane Citizen through Education.<br><br>
        
        Accordingly, the college has introduced Islamic Studies as one of the optional subjects at B.A degree course from the academic year 2008-2009.<br>
         The college has a long standing academic tradition and boasts of a team of 39 experienced,
